## Context
Olist is the largest e-commerce platform in Brazilian online marketplaces which connects and offers a solution for buying and selling on online. Olist wants to obtain a segmentation of its customers that their marketing team can use in their daily communication campaigns. The dataset provided by Olist has information of ~100k customers and sellers from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces. 
 
 
 ## Goal:
 - To understand the different types of users through their behavior and anonymized personal data.
 
 ## Objectives:
 My mission is to to help Olist teams understand the different types of users. Thus, I will use unsupervised methods to:

 - provide an analysis of the stability of the segments over time in order to establish a maintenance contract.
 - group together customers with similar profiles that can be used by the marketing team for better communication.
